 												//DYNAMIC SCALAR PROJECTION:
 												-------------------------
 												
In JPA (Java Persistence API), dynamic scalar projection is a feature that allows you to select specific columns from a query rather than retrieving entire entity objects. 
This can be particularly useful when you only need a subset of the data from a table, which can improve the performance of your application by reducing the amount of data transferred from the database.

How It Works:
-------------------
Dynamic scalar projection in JPA is typically achieved using the createQuery() method of the EntityManager or 
through the @Query annotation in a repository interface if you're using Spring Data JPA. You specify only the fields you are interested in,
and the result can be returned in various formats such as a tuple, an array of objects, or a custom DTO (Data Transfer Object).


Advantages of Dynamic Scalar Projection:
----------------------------------------------
Performance: Less data is transferred from the database, which can improve retrieval speed, especially for large datasets.
Flexibility: Allows fetching only the necessary data, which can be particularly useful for reports or views where full entities are not required.
Resource Efficiency: Reduces memory usage on both the database server and the application server since less data is loaded into memory.
Dynamic scalar projection is a powerful tool in JPA for optimizing database interactions in Java applications, especially when dealing with large or complex datasets.
